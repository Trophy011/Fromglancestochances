      <p class="mb-4">Guys.. My name is <strong>Ivan Meneses</strong>, and for years, I was a master of wishful thinking. Whether I was getting mixed signals or just crushing from afar, I was terrified to show my true feelings for fear of getting hurt.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">I created a system to track and analyze these signals, and for the first time, I felt in charge of my choices. That system is what I've put together for you here.</p>
